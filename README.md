# Bosque-Health 🏥

An advanced academic software solution developed for the **Programming I** course (Semester 2024-2). This project is a comprehensive medical appointment and management system designed to demonstrate mastery of **Core Java** and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 🌟 Overview

**Bosque-Health** is a multi-role platform tailored for medical environments. It provides specialized interfaces and functionalities for patients, doctors, and executive directors. Although it simulates a real-world medical application, its primary goal is to showcase robust logic, data structures, and system architecture using **Pure Java**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Multi-Role Access:** Customized dashboards for Patients, Doctors, and High-Level Executives.
* **Appointment Management:** Full lifecycle for scheduling, viewing, and managing medical consultations.
* **Laboratory & Exams:** Module for tracking and viewing clinical laboratory results.
* **Medical Scheduling:** Specialized tools for doctors to manage their availability and patient queues.
* **Executive Reporting:** Data-driven reporting module for administrative decision-making.
* **Automated Notifications:** Email integration for appointment reminders and system alerts.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Language:** Java 23 (Core Java)
* **IDE:** Optimized for [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* **Libraries:** Standard Java SE libraries and JavaMail API for notifications.
* **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a focus on modularity and clean code.
